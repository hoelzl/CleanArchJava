# Beverages Using the Decorator Pattern

The package `beverages.v1_sk` contains a simple implementation of
beverages for a cash point system in a café.

The café now wants to be able to charge clients for adding extras such
as milk and sugar to their drinks. Extend the given implementation using
the Decorator pattern so that this becomes possible. Create a few drinks
with various combinations of extras in the `main()` method to test your
changes.
