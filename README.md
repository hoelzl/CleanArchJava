# Clean Architecture and Design Patterns

Some code files for the Clean Architecture course.

Some websites with resources for design patterns are:

- The [Portland Pattern Repository](http://c2.com/ppr/index.html), 
  in particular the 
  [Software Design Patterns Index](https://wiki.c2.com/?SoftwareDesignPatternsIndex)
- The [Hillside group](https://hillside.net/) website, with a
  library of [pattern books](https://hillside.net/patterns/books)
  and a [patterns catalog](https://hillside.net/component/weblinks/category/61-patterns-catalog)
- Martin Fowler's [website](https://refactoring.com/) (use site
  search to discover the pattern catalogs)
